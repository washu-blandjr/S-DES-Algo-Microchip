# S-DES-Algo-Microchip
Final project fpr Digital IC Class. Done with Hussein A. and Nicole E.

This repo contains the files from our Digital Integrated Circuit final project. Me, Hussein A., and Nicole E. designed a plethora of schematics and layouts. The final result is a 1.5mm by 1.5mm, 40 pin microchip. When 1-bit enable is set to 1, and on a rising clock edge, the output from an 8-bit input, 10-bit key is displayed.
